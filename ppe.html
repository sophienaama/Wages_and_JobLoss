        <h2>How PPE is Failing Women
        </h2>
        <h3>70% of healthcare workers are women. So why is PPE designed for men?
        </h3>
        <div class="byline">

          <p>May 7, 2020</p>

      <div class="text">

        <p>Every evening people across the country gather on porches and balconies and at their windows to clap in appreciation for healthcare workers as they go to and from work in emergency rooms, hospice and laboratories facing direct exposure of
          COVID-19. </p>

        <p>Images of women with marks on their faces after wearing masks for the entirety of their shifts have gone viral, as these women work on the frontlines to fight a virus, they are in greater risk to contract the virus as PPE is not always
          fitted for the frame of woman.</p>

        <p>As of 2019, women make a large percentage of healthcare workers in the United States. In pediatrics, hospice and genetics women make up 66% of the field, based on the 2019 Medscape report. Nurses are the nation’s largest healthcare
          profession; they are also the most hand-on with a patient as they see to the patient’s care. In the United States there are 3.8 million registered nurses (RNs) and 85% of them are women. </p>

        <p> According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), the PPE must be worn correctly before treating patients with COVID-19. Because the virus is thought to be transmitted from person to person. Healthcare employees are required to wear an
          N95
          respiratory mask, while in the unit. While attending a patient the worker is required to wear an isolation gown, an N95 facemask, gloves and a full-face visor. Respirator masks, like the N95, need to be fit tested. According to CDC
          guidelines, the mask should extend to
          the
          chin and completely cover the nose and cheek area without any gaps. </p>

        </div>

        <p> However, masks are not made with long hair in mind, one nurse said she experiences difficulty with an N95 mask because of her long hair, even with a ponytail. It makes the mask more uncomfortable and in some cases the mask will not stay
          on
          the workers face. </p>

        <p> Nesha Shaw is a nurse’s supervisor at an outpatient hospital in California. Her unit, primary care, deals directly with COVID-19. They have tents set up in parking lot, with nurses ready to test those who are experiencing symptoms. Shaw
          and
          her colleagues are required to be in full PPE for their entire shift. </p>

        <p>“We have different faces. It is not comfortable and the end of the day I have bruises on my nose I have marks on my face,” Shaw said. “It’s one size fits all but it’s not one size fits all because we all have different faces." </p>

        <p> In order to feel more protected, Shaw adds a surgical mask over the N95. </p>

        <p> Medical supplies are not made with the woman in mind, masks, gloves and disposable gowns are made for figures much larger than a woman. </p>

        <p> CovCare, a medical supply company offers three sizes of medical isolation gowns, available in small, medium and large. The sample size is based on the body of a man and the models used to advertise the fit of the gown are men. </p>

        <p> "Our biggest problem is the gown, it is too long. If you have a person who is of short stature the gown will be too long,” said Barbara Gordon, a unit manager at a hospital in California.</p>

        <p> Based on a survey of female medical workers in the United States, women are found to have most problems with the fit are hairnets, facemasks and shields. One healthcare worker said their face shield kept slipping and falling onto the
          patient she was treating or dangling from her face. </p>

        <p> In the case of Shaw, the face visors were very ill-fitted for the women of the unit. Shaw and her colleagues received a donation of face visors from an engineering firm in April and the fit of the visor was more suited to their faces. As
          a gift to the unit, the supervisors ordered face visors for the female healthcare workers of the unit. </p>

        <p> Based on the American Hospital Association Annual Survey, there are 5,686 hospitals in the United States. Of that total, 2,904 are public hospitals, and 1,060 are private. Because of the rules in place at private hospitals healthcare
          workers are unable to express their concerns with PPE. </p>

        <p> Nurses of the med surge unit at Providence Saint John’s hospital were suspended after refusing to work without an n95 mask. The hospital denied them the respirator mask despite being the unit caring for the COVID-19 patients. </p>

        <p> “The CDC has really failed nurses by downgrading their recommend recommended precautions for COVID from the downgrade from airborne precautions to surgical masks and that only had to do with the shortage in New York,” Allison Mayol, a med
          surge nurse at Providence said. </p>

        <p> Mayol and the rest of her unit were suspended until the end of April. When they returned, they were given masks. However, they were informed to keep the same mask for the duration of the crisis. </p>

        <p> Due to the lack of medical equipment, health workers are now asked to clean and disinfect the mask and reuse it. </p>

        <p> As of April, nearly 9,300 healthcare workers contracted COVID-19, according to the CDC, 27 have died. Those who tested positive believed they were exposed while at work. A large majority of those tested positive are women. </p>
