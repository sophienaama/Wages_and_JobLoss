      <p>Every evening people across the country gather on porches and balconies and at their windows to clap in appreciation for healthcare workers.
        Videos of women walking to and from work to work in emergency rooms, hospice and laboratories facing direct exposure of COVID-19. </p>
      <p>Images of women with marks on their faces after wearing masks for the entirety of their shifts have gone viral, as these women work on the frontline to fight a virus,
        women are in greater risk to the virus as PPE is not always fitted for the frame of woman.</p>
      <p>As of 2019, women make a large percentage of healthcare workers in the United States, in pediatrics, hospice and genetics women make up 66% of the field, based on the 2019 Medscape report.
        Nurses are the nation’s largest healthcare profession, with 3.8 million registered nurses (RNs) and a majority of them being women. </p>
      <p>Yet medical supplies are not made with the woman in mind, as masks, gloves and disposable gowns are made for figures much larger than a woman.
        Based on a survey of more than 20 medical workers in the United States, women are found to have most problem with the fit are hairnets, facemasks and shields. </p>
      <p>One healthcare worker said their face shield kept slipping and falling onto the patient she was treating or dangling from her face.
        CovCare, a medical supply and logistics company based out New York sizes medical gowns according to men’s sizes, in fact the models used to display the hospital gowns are men of various sizes.
        “I do not fit into an isolation gown,” Alison Mayol, nurse the San Diego Presbyterian Medical Center. “The gowns are so big if I wear one to treat a patient it would not fit.
        We are asked to bring in a poncho or something that would fit.” </p>

      </div>

      <p>According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), the personnel protective equipment must be worm correctly before treating patients with COVID-19.
        It is required of healthcare workers to have the correct size of gown as well as a mask that should extend to the chin and completely cover the nose and cheek area without any gaps. </p>

      <p>That is difficult for women, as masks are not easily tied securely with long hair.
        One nurse said she experiences difficulty with an N95 mask because the length of her hair,
        even with a ponytail, wearing a mask has proven to be difficult. </p>

      <p>Based on the American Hospital Association Annual Survey, there are 5,686 hospitals in the United States.
        Of that total, 2,904 are public hospitals, and 1,060 are private.
        Because of the rules in place at private hospitals healthcare workers are unable to express their concerns with PPE.</p>
      <p>In the case of Mayol, the lack of PPE and appropriate fitting PPE there after led to the walkout of her unit.
        She and her coworkers, 11 women and 2 men were suspended for two weeks for complaining of their treatment.
        When they returned, they were given masks and better fitting isolations gowns. However, they were informed to keep the same mask and gowns for the duration of the crisis.
        Due to the lack of medical equipment, health workers are now asked to clean and disinfect the mask and reuse it. </p>
