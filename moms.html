        <p>Claire Song, a web designer in Hoboken, New Jersey, spent a lot of time at home doing her work last week as usual. But since the coronavirus changed the landscape of work spaces, – the increase of home working, Song isn't the only one
          spending the whole week at home. Her husband, who works for Logistics, also stayed at home. While both her and her husband worked at home, she is in charge of cooking three times a day, doing laundry twice a week, and vacuuming every other
          day.</p>

        <p>“Definitely I have more daily chores these days,” said Song. “One thing that hasn't changed: I’m the one who’s taking more time for domestic work.” Song is not the only woman who spends more time for household chores under the country's
          widespread stay-at-home orders."</p>

        <p>Lockdowns amid the coronavirus have forced many to work from home, or caused them to be furloughed or even without a job. Parents need to be teachers and playmates for their children because schools are closed. The burdens of cooking,
          cleaning and childcare tend to fall on the women in heterosexual couples.</p>

        <p>“This is a total disaster to moms like me,” said Stella Wayne, a mother of two kids who works as an office worker at a tax account office in Orlando, Florida. She said that she is not the only mom who’s juggling childcare and work at home
          after children stopped going to school due to the pandemic. Because she is the most skilled at cooking and cleaning, she usually manages more household affairs than any others at home. “My husband helps me to manage all the things, but
          literally, he helps. Not sharing.”</p>

        <p>OECD data has already showed that women in the United States spend 1.6 times more than men for unpaid work; men spend about 17.5 hours a week, and women spend about 28.4 hours a week doing unpaid labor. The United Nations also
          reported that women do 2.6 times more unpaid domestic works and caregiving than men.</p>
